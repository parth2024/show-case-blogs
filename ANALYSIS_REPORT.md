## NEXT STEPS

Would you like me to proceed with implementing these fixes? I recommend we:

1. **Create a unified footer component** that all apps can use (with color theme customization)
2. **Add the scroll-to-top button** to daycare and primaire
3. **Implement cross-app navigation** in daycare and primaire (similar to nursery)
4. **Fix article display** to use database with empty state handling
5. **Standardize contact information** (pending your verification of correct details)

Please confirm which fixes you'd like me to implement first, or if you'd like me to proceed with all of them.
